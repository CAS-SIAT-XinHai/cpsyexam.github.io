						<h2>CPsyExam Benchmark</h2>
						<p>Due to the specificity of the psychology domain, in order to comprehensively address the ability of
							LLMs in understanding of psychological cases, we then divide CPsyExam into two parts: 
							<br/>
							(1) Knowledge (KG) contains factoid-oriented questions with a wider coverage of psychology concepts from real examinations for professional counsellors, 
							<br/>
							(2) Case Analysis (CA) includes case-oriented questions focusing on method, diagnosis and treatment required during counselling.</p>
					
							<br/>
							<br/>
							
						<h2>CPsyExam-KG</h2>
						
						
						<p>
							CPsyExam-KG consists of four Chinese examinations that includes psychology subjects:
							<br/>
							<strong>PCE</strong>(Psychological Counselor Examination):The professional qualification examinations
							for first, second, and third-tier psychological
							counselors are designed to assess the competence and knowledge of individuals working
							in the field of psychology. These exams are 
							typically structured as a series of multiple-choice or essay questions that cover various
							aspects of psychology.
							<br/>
							<strong>TQE</strong>(Teachers’ Qualification Examination):
							The Teachers' Qualification Examination is a standardized assessment for individuals 
							who wish to teach in primary, middle, and high schools, as well as in vocational schools and higher education institutions. 
							This examination is designed to ensure that educators possess the necessary psychology knowledge and skills to effectively teach courses.
							<br/>
							<strong>GEE</strong>(Graduate Entrance Examinations):
							It contains a wide range of subjects like general psychology, social psychology, experimental psychology, contemporary educational psychology, psychology and educational measurement, developmental psychology, modern psychology, and educational statistics.
							<br/>
							<strong>SSE</strong>(Self-study Examination):
							The Self-study Examination is an examination that assesses an individual's knowledge and understanding of psychology, specifically in the areas of educational psychology, medical psychology, advertising psychology, and journalism psychology. This examination is typically taken by individuals who are self-studying or not enrolled in a formal educational program.
						
						</p>
						<br/>
							<br/>
						<h2>CPsyExam-CA</h2>
						<p>
							The questions in CPsyExam-CA are also collected from above four examinations, and are divided into three categories based on the skills required during counselling:
							<br/>
							<strong>Method</strong>:
							assesses the LLM's ability to use the corresponding methodology in a specific case. 
							<br/>
							<strong>Diagnosis</strong>:
							pays attention to the LLM's ability to diagnose the visitor's illness.  
							<br/>
							<strong>Treatment</strong>:
							evaluates LLM's ability to treat patients.
